Temporary Expert: Designing for Education
=========================================

K-12 through Higher Ed.

Course content is organized along 2 parallel tracks: The first is topical and intended to build a broad-ranging knowledge of education from demographics and pedagogy to assessment and business models through collaborative research. The second is practical and meant to provide hands-on experience with an iterative approach to design from developing user scenarios to self-experimentation to rapid prototyping and testing.

Questions we’ll tackle include:

1. Does education need technology like a fish needs a bicycle?

2. Can we apply learnings from web instrumentation and behavioral analytics to reimagine how we assess student AND teacher performance so that assessment is a natural byproduct of instruction, not a disruption of it? Can assessment itself become a form of instruction?

3. How can we leverage technology to remodel the classroom along the lines of the modern workplace with its demands for collaboration, self-direction and the ability to tackle uncertainty with gusto!

4. Who are the stakeholders in edtech? Who are the decision-makers?

5. What are the challenges to adoption and perhaps more importantly sales!

6. How do you test the efficacy of edtech? Is it even possible at this stage?

Class Structure
---------------

Topics are organized on a 2 week cycle. Each cycle adds another layer of complexity to the challenges of designing technology solutions for education.

You will be asked to research and “teach” a specific topic area as well as present and evaluate solutions. Students will work in groups of 3-4 for the first 8 weeks. The last 4 weeks will be devoted to individual research, design and prototyping of a particular solution.

1st week of 2-week cycle
- Groups present their sketches/prototypes from the previous week.
- Overview of next set of topic(s).
Assignment
- Each group chooses 1 topic to research for the following week.
- Research includes background reading, academic papers, interviews and analysis of existing solutions.
- Identify a specific aspect of your problem area to address.

2nd week of 2-week cycle
- Each group presents on their topic and leads a group brainstorming exercises for possible solutions.
- In-class Workshops: Prototyping Techniques
—  Storyboarding user scenarios
—  Diagramming workflows
—  Sketching interface wireframes in Powerpoint or Photoshop
—  Paper prototyping interaction
—  JS prototyping frameworks
Assignment
- Design Exercise

Syllabus
--------

Work-in-progress.
Readings and guest speakers TBD.

### Weeks 1 + 2
Education, What’s the point?
- Thomas Dewey: Democracy and Education
- Tracking and Vocational Education

The Demographics of Education
- Who’s getting educated?
- Where? 
- For how long? 
- And in what kind of educational institutions?

Does education need tech?
- Uruguay v. U.S. v Finland

Does education need disruption?
- Lab schools
- Charter schools

What do we mean by EdTech?
Technology that educates?
Technology for educators?
Technology used by educational institutions?
Technology for education administrators and policymakers?
Technology for students?

Design Practice: A day in the life of your user. 
- Building empathy through storyboarding.
- Quantitative and qualitative approaches to telling your user’s story.

Design Practice: Workflow diagrams
- What could go wrong? Diagramming non-linear workflows.

### Weeks 3 + 4 + 5
Pedagogy
Possible Topics:
- Drill ‘n Kill, Sage on a Stage
- The Common Core, Higher-order Literacy, 21st C Skills
- Close Reading, Balanced Literacy, The “New” Math of the 80s
- The pros and cons of reading on Devices v. Paper
- Flip: Does flip and video change what should go into the lecture?
- Adaptive Learning: Does it work for everything?
- Gamification: Do you actually learn anything?
- Inquiry and project-based learning: Is it practical?
- This is your mind on metaphors.
- Low-stakes quizzing: Assessment as teaching.
- Programming: Vocational or core curriculum?

Design Practice: Self-experimentation.
- Pick 2 pedagogical methods. Try both. Design a no-tech lesson for the class using the one that you think worked better.
- What are the stated goals of this method?
- How did you assess whether these goals were met?
- Pick the more effective one and design a lesson for the class.

Design Practice: Evaluating existing products.
- Select 3 products that claim to implement the technique you researched.
- Compare and contrast them.
- Are any of them an improvement on what you did without tech?
- Are there any side effects?
- Pick the best one and prepare a lesson for the class.

Design Practice: Rapid prototyping designs.
- Prototype + test 3 designs for the pedagogical method you chose in the previous week.

### Week 6
#### Non-Academic Factors in Educational Success
- Culture and Economics 
- Psychology and Behavioral Economics (e.g. Grit, Confidence, Priming)
- ESL and Learning Challenges

#### Design Practice: Brainstorming
- Different ways to “prime” your confidence?
- How can coursework be restructured to make it harder to fall behind?

#### Design Practice: Iteration
- Revisit your design with behavioral psychology in mind.

### Weeks 7-8
#### Assessment and Admissions
- What’s being measured today? What should we be measuring?
- Brief history of the S.A.T. and the latest reimagining.
- NYC Specialized H.S. assessment controversy.
- Common Core assessments (NYS v. elsewhere).
- Low versus High-stakes Testing (US, China/Korea)
- Cheating (by students *and* teachers/administrators)
- The challenges of scaling writing assessment.
- Assessing teachers.

<b>Design Practice:</b> Rapid prototyping
Imagine a new assessment for writing. Address the following:
- Cheating
- Scale
- High stakes v low stakes
- Relevance: What are we actually assessing?

<b>Design Practice:</b> Iteration
- Revisit your design and turn it into an assessment tool.

### Class 8 - Propose an area to focus on for the rest of the semester.
- Focus: Teacher, Student, Administrator
- Demographics
- Level of education
- Starting point: Pedagogy, Behavior Psych, Assessment, Logistics/Administration

### Weeks 9-10
#### IT/Logistics, Adoption/Deployment and Measuring Efficacy
- Connectivity
- Choosing hardware and the perils of platform lock-in.
- Deployment fiascos. (Amplify, L.A. School District)
- The challenges of persuading teachers to adopt new technologies.
- (The lack of) professional development (teacher training).
- Nascent attempts to test efficacy of software (e.g. LEAP-Chicago, NYC DOE)
- EdSurge’s product review catalog

#### The Economics of Education
- Budget breakdown: Administrative versus Instructional versus Physical Plant
- What should we be measuring?
- Non-profit versus for-profit
- The economics of:
— Investment
— Philanthropy (e.g. Newark, Gates Foundation)
— Publishing and licensing content / Open Educational Resources
— Sales
— Regulation (e.g. Common core. Teacher evaluations.)
— Retention (e.g. Drop-out rate. Building lazy rivers.)
— Labor (e.g. Adjuncts and grad students)
— Scale: MOOCs and Adaptive Learning
- Alternate Paths to Education
— Minerva, the $30K elite education
— $1K college degree (e.g. Straighterline, Kepler)
