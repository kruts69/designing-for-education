What's this class about?
------------------------

K-12 through Higher Ed.

Some of the questions we’ll tackle:

1. Does education need technology like a fish needs a bicycle? What do we even mean by "ed-tech?"

2. Can we apply learnings from web instrumentation and behavioral analytics to reimagine how we assess student AND teacher performance so that assessment is a natural byproduct of instruction, not a disruption of it? Can assessment itself become a form of instruction?

3. How can we leverage technology to remodel the classroom along the lines of the modern workplace with its demands for collaboration, self-direction and the ability to tackle uncertainty with gusto!

4. Who are the stakeholders in edtech? Who are the decision-makers?

5. What are the challenges to adoption and perhaps more importantly sales!

6. How do you test the efficacy of edtech? Is it even possible at this stage?

Course content is organized along 2 parallel tracks: The first is topical and intended to build a broad-ranging knowledge of education from demographics and pedagogy to assessment and business models through collaborative research. The second is practical and meant to provide hands-on experience with an iterative approach to design from developing user scenarios to self-experimentation to rapid prototyping and testing.

We will be working with various local schools, organizations and programs to arrange for some form of "classroom" observation. Students also have the option of signing up for an online course in place of observing a physical classroom.

Class Structure
---------------

Topics are organized on a 2-3 week cycle. Each cycle adds another layer of complexity to the challenges of designing technology solutions for education.

You will be asked to research and “teach” a specific topic area as well as present and evaluate solutions. Students will work in groups of 3-4 for the first 8 weeks. The last 4 weeks will be devoted to individual research, design and prototyping of a particular solution.

1st week of 2-week cycle
- Groups present their sketches/prototypes from the previous week.
- Overview of next set of topic(s).
Assignment
- Each group chooses 1 topic to research for the following week.
- Research includes background reading, academic papers, interviews and analysis of existing solutions.
- Identify a specific aspect of your problem area to address.

2nd week of 2-week cycle
- Each group presents on their topic and leads a group brainstorming exercises for possible solutions.
- In-class Workshops: Prototyping Techniques
—  Storyboarding user scenarios
—  Diagramming workflows
—  Sketching interface wireframes in Powerpoint or Photoshop
—  Paper prototyping interaction
—  JS prototyping frameworks
Assignment
- Design Exercise
